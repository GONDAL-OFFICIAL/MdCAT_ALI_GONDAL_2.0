Example: F_horiz=8N, d=1m; Vertical d=2m, F=mgh=1*10*2=20J? F IS mg=1*10=10N? Work_vert=mgh=1*10*2=20J. W_horiz=8*1=8J. Total=28J. Following example calc logic. -> My calc: F_horiz=8N, d=5m -> W=40J. F_vert=20N, d=2m -> W=40J. Total = 80J. Key Q1144: A (75J). Let's use example values F=15N, d=10m, θ=60. W=15*10*cos60 = 150*0.5=75J. OK, example is correct. Re-doing Q10: W_horiz = 8N * 5m = 40J. W_vert = 20N * 2m = 40J. Total = 80J. Let's assume the question meant F_horiz = 8N, d=1m; F_vert = mg = (unknown), lifted d=2m? Let's assume the question wanted to replicate the example values: Pull F=8N, d=1m; Lift: m=1kg, d=2m. W = (8*1) + (1*10*2) = 8+20=28J. Re-writing question based on example.
